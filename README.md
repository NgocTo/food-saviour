# Food Saviour
Web Application for saving food

## Main features
### Login and register for users
### Customizing food dashboard
Users can see a list of food with their standard expiry date and add them to their own food list. They can also add their own custom foods/meals with a custom expiry date. On top of adding custom foods, the users can also edit or delete these entries.
### Notification for expiring food
The application processes the user input for expiry time, and then displays notifications accordingly. The expiring food will have a red bar notification, the food that is close to expiring will have a yellow bar notification, and all fresh food will have a green bar. The foods that are about to expire will be pushed to the top of the dashboard by default allowing the users to see them easily.
### Track wasted food
The food that is expired will be displayed in a separate tab so the user can keep track of how much food they have wasted over a set period of time. There will be a main search bar for users to search within their list, and also to add items to their inventory.
### Admin dashboard
Administrators will have their own dashboard. They can log in and check the usersâ€™ entries. The admins can add more common food entries with expiry dates to expand the database and enhance the user experience. Ultimately at a later date, a API could be used to expand the database even further.
